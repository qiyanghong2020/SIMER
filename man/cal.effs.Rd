\arguments{
\item{pop.geno}{genotype of population, a individual has two columns}

\item{incols}{the column number of an individual in the input genotype matrix, it can be 1 or 2}

\item{cal.model}{phenotype models with the options: "A", "AD", "ADI"}

\item{num.qtn.tr1}{integer or integer vector, the number of QTN in a single trait}

\item{sd.tr1}{standard deviation of different effects, the last 5 vector elements are corresponding to d, aXa, aXd, dXa, dXd respectively and the rest elements are corresponding to a}

\item{dist.qtn.tr1}{distributions of the QTN effects with the options: "normal", "geometry", "gamma", and "beta", vector elements are corresponding to a, d, aXa, aXd, dXa, dXd respectively}

\item{prob.tr1}{unit effect of geometric distribution, its length should be same as dist.qtn.tr1}

\item{shape.tr1}{shape of gamma distribution of a single trait, its length should be same as dist.qtn.tr1}

\item{scale.tr1}{scale of gamma distribution of a single trait, its length should be same as dist.qtn.tr1}

\item{shape1.tr1}{non-negative parameters of the Beta distribution, its length should be same as dist.qtn.tr1}

\item{shape2.tr1}{non-negative parameters of the Beta distribution, its length should be same as dist.qtn.tr1}

\item{ncp.tr1}{non-centrality parameter, its length should be same as dist.qtn.tr1}

\item{multrait}{whether to apply multiple traits, TRUE represents applying, FALSE represents not}

\item{num.qtn.trn}{QTN distribution matrix, diagonal elements are QTN number of the trait, non-diagonal elements are QTN number of overlap QTN between two traits}

\item{sd.trn}{a matrix with the standard deviation of the QTN effects}

\item{qtn.spot}{QTN probability in every block}

\item{maf}{Minor Allele Frequency, marker selection range is from  maf to 0.5}

\item{verbose}{whether to print detail}
